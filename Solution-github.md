## Architecture overview

```scss
User (Browser)
   ↓ HTTPS
Custom Domain (ahmadquraan.htufolio.com)
   ↓ Route 53 (DNS)
CloudFront Distribution
   ↓ Origin Access Control (OAC)
Private S3 Bucket
   ↓
index.html + static assets

```


![](b4da18f0be779656a71f4945e5ae630d.png)

* Key points:
	- The S3 bucket is **private**
	- All traffic goes through **CloudFront**
	- HTTPS is enabled using **ACM**
	- DNS is managed using **Route 53**




---



## S3 Bucket (Static Website Storage)

1) Make a S3 bucket.
2) Upload the content on it `index.html`,...
3) Ensured `index.html` is located at the **root of the bucket**
4) Ensure it's private (don't uncheck the default)




---




## CloudFront (content delivery network)

CloudFront provides performance, security, and HTTPS support.

* Create a new distribution and in Origin --> put the S3 domain name.
* Origin path --> write "index.html" --> **Default root object**: `index.html`
* Leave every setting as it is .
* OAC (Origin access control) --> Just allow the cloudFront to access the S3 bucket, public access is blocked.

## ACM certificate (HTTPS)

 ### Sub-content
 * [#Why making ACM certificate?](%23Why%20making%20ACM%20certificate%3F)
 * [#How to make ACM certificate ?](%23How%20to%20make%20ACM%20certificate%20%3F)
 * [#How ACM and CloudFront integrate ?](%23How%20ACM%20and%20CloudFront%20integrate%20%3F)


### Why making ACM certificate? 

* Now if we tried to put the record (cloud front with ahmadquraan.htufolio) in the hosted zone in Route 53, we will face a big issue which is that our domain is not secure (HTTP), and such window will appear.
* ![](7e4dc29351fb9fcab41e4552fc3de85d.png)

* and to make it secure we need to make a certification using **AWS Certificate manager**.

## How to make ACM certificate ?

```bash
search certificate manager --> request # Make sure you are in us-east-1
```

* Certificate was created in **us-east-1** (required for CloudFront). --> doesn't accept any other certificate.
* ![](9b4e77e28e0466f4b019eff3a084b725.png)

* After that:
![](f08558455a209a8ce52795ae3ab1ae36.png)
 * In the domain name just put your domain name (the one you wanna make a record on the hosted zone) ex: **ahmadquraan.htufolio.com**.
 * Now two values will appear in the certification, CNAME name and value.
 * ![](6c80cb3100b0e1d23117a92934cda928.png)
 * Now the certification will remain under "validation" until you make a specific DNS record for it in the hosted zone using those values--> **Create this CNAME record with this exact value**.  The ACM record **Must be created in the SAME hosted zone as the domain** you’re requesting the certificate for.
 * So go to the hosted zone (Yazan IAM account) then make a new record there with the **CNAME name as it's name and CNAME value as it's value**
 
	 * The reason is **You need the ACM DNS record to prove that you own the domain.**  
	* CloudFront will not trust or use a certificate unless ACM has verified that ownership.
	* The key principle: _Who are you to claim this domain?_ so because anybody can generate a certificate for domains they don't own, AWS will ask you to provide the DNS record to approve that you own it .

* Now after making the certification and the ACM record in the hosted zone, the certification will change it's status into "Issued".
* After that you need to get back to the cloudFront and give it the certification that you wanna use. `CloudFront -> General -> Edit`
	* The CNAME -> IS your domain name.
	* SSL certificate -> your certification.

### How ACM and CloudFront integrate ?

[#ACM (Certificate Authority role)](%23ACM%20(Certificate%20Authority%20role))
[#CloudFront (Web server / CDN role)](%23CloudFront%20(Web%20server%20%2F%20CDN%20role))



#### ACM (Certificate Authority role)

* ACM’s job is only to:
	- Verify domain ownership
	- Issue SSL/TLS certificates
	- Renew them automatically

* ACM **does not**:
	- Serve websites
	- Handle user traffic
	- Terminate HTTPS connections

* Once ACM issues the certificate, its job is basically done.
####  CloudFront (Web server / CDN role)

* CloudFront’s job is to:
	- Accept browser connections
	- Terminate HTTPS (TLS handshake)
	- Serve content from S3

* But CloudFront **cannot guess** which certificate you want.

* So you must tell it:
> “When someone visits this domain, use THIS certificate.”


* So CloudFront:
	- Stores the certificate
	- Uses it during TLS handshakes
	- Presents it to browsers
* For that we attach the cloudFront with the certificate after make it and verify it throw making the ACM record.

## Route 53 (DNS configuration)

* Now in **htufolio.com**, 2 records have been created:
	1) ACM record:
		* Type: CNAME
		* These are the values we should make the ACM record with:
	```bash
CNAME name: _17bbfb5bfe5ff40e2bb9df65cb0e97c8.ahmadquraan.htufolio.com
CNAME value: _c3bccf0a4878085a4084522ef1f69804.jkddzztszm.acm-validations.aws
	```
	
	![](87bb3f36d2f15cede198944a13361bc3.png)

	
	2) Website record (Main record):
		* type: CNAME
		* Name: ahmadquraan
		* Value: dxxxxxxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net

## Cross-Account Setup (Important Detail)

- CloudFront, S3, and ACM are in **my personal AWS account**.
- Route 53 hosted zone is in **Yazan AWS account**.
- Because of this:
    - **CNAME** was used (not Alias).
    - Alias records only work when Route 53 and CloudFront are in the **same account**.




---



## Final Result

- Website is accessible at:
`https://ahmadquraan.htufolio.com`
- HTTPS works correctly (lock icon 🔒).
- S3 bucket is private.
- CloudFront serves the site securely and efficiently.
- DNS resolves correctly using Route 53.



---


##  One-Line Conclusion 

> This project deploys a secure static portfolio on AWS using a private S3 bucket, CloudFront with Origin Access Control, ACM for HTTPS, and Route 53 for custom domain DNS management.
